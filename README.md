# MLB-Pitching-Prospect-Analysis
This repository includes a study report and code focused on predicting pitch speed in baseball using height and time. The analysis involved permutation methods and cross-validation to estimate height and pitch speed. However, the findings revealed no significant correlation between height and pitch speed.

Included are the report and a compiled html file generated from a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains the code I wrote for my analysis along with descriptive steps.
